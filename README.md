# How to fork and clone
One quick note about cloning this project. If you wish to make commits and push your own code, you'll need to fork the project first. Forking allows you to have your own copy of this repository by adding a duplicate version in your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

## API URL Configuration
If you look into project structure there is a file under src `config.js`. Here is the link to that file [config.js](src\config.js). This file contains the variables that define the service(learner-user-service and learner-product-service) URL and API URLs. If there is any change in host URL or service URL it can be updated within that file.
